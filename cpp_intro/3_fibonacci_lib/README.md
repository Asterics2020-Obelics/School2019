# Libraries


## Task

* Create a shared library `libfibonacci`, that has a function
`fibonacci`, to calculate fibonacci numbers.

Split the code into a `.cpp` file with the implementation and
a `.h` file containing the API definition.

* Create an executable `main.cpp` that uses the library to print numbers to the
console


## Hints

* include guards
* `--shared`, `-L`, `-I` options to g++/clang++
* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or runtime path
