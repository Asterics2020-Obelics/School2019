# Using the system LaTeX installation with matplotlib

We use the pgf backend of matplotlib to create publication quality pdf
plots.

The example uses the modern `lualatex` engine, so you'll need a relatively 
recent `TeXLive`, everything >= 2016 should work.

The method itself also supports `pdflatex` and `xelatex`.
