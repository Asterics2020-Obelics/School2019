\begin{frame}[c]{What is Version Control?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Version Control tracks changes of a (collection of) document(s)
    \item This can basically be anything: software, legal documents, documentation, scientific paper
    \item We will call a snapshot of such a collection a \enquote{revision}.
    \item Revisions are the complete history of our projects
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Why Use Version Control?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Allows us to go back to arbitrary revisions
    \item Shows differences between revisions
    \item Enables collaborative working
    \item Acts as backup if used together with a remote server
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Why Use Version Control?}
  Most Version Control Systems (VCS) make answering the following questions easy:
  \begin{description}
    \item[What?] What changed from revision a to revision b?
    \item[Who?] Who made a change? Who contributed?
    \item[Why?] VCS usually encourage or even force adding explanations to changes.
    \item[When?] In which revision was a bug introduced or fixed?
  \end{description}
